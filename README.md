#Reverse inference

<b><i>Exploring machine learning models for predicting Schizophrenia in indidividuals</i></b>

Revere inverse is the process by which we can infer cognitive functions within a brain using brain imaging data.

Where forward inference is defined by the probability of observing brain 
activity given the mental state under investigation, reverse inference is the 
probability of a particular mental state given the observed brain 
activity.

Rervse inference has many applications, and different kinds of tools that can be
used in the inference process, neuroimaging data is just one of type of data that
is used in this field.

Here, I explore an example of 'predicting diagnosis of new patient using imaging
data', with a focus on Schizophrenia as the mental disorder being diagnosed.
